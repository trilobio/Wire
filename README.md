# Wire
Custom copy of Wire library with the internal buffer extended to 34 bytes

The Wire library in Arduino has a Lesser GNU Public License, meaning that we must
open-source any changes to it. We only need to change the internal buffer length,
but we're providing this version of the library in case anyone else also wants that.
